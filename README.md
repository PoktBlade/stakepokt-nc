# [Stakepokt.com](https://stakepokt.com) Non Custodial Staking Tool 

An alternative tool inspired to make your life easier by performing **bulk non-custodial stakes** with minimal effort. We made this tool for a specific client so they wouldn't have to go through the pains of filling out a form and pressing stake `n` times on https://wallet.pokt.network. Feel free to use for your own use case!
All transaction generation and signing is performed within your browser locally. Only the signed tx is broadcasted to an RPC node to digest and ultimately be placed into the mempool.

##### Note: Still in experimental, use at your own risk.
